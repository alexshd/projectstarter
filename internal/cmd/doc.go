// Package cmd provides the command-line interface for the proj tool.
//
// The tests are empty placeholders because the actual logic of the CLI commands
// is minimal and primarily serves as an entry point to the underlying generator
// functionality. The generators themselves are thoroughly tested in the
// internal/generator package.
//
// Testing CLI commands would require complex setup and provide limited value,
// as the core functionality resides in the generator implementations.
